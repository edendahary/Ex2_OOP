# Ex2_OOP
This is an object oriented programmin project which his main idea is based on functions.

This Project Made by Eden Dahary Student in Ariel University.

This project contains an stdDraw interface .

in this project we implements data structure, algorithms and GUI.

node (vertex) in a (directional) weighted graph.

## Edge Class
This Class represents the set of operations applicable on a 
directional edge(src,dest) in a (directional) weighted graph.

## DGraph Class
This Class represents a directional weighted graph.

## Graph_Algo
This Class represents the "regular" Graph Theory algorithms.
